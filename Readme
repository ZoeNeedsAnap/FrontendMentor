# Frontend Mentor Challenge Solutions

This repository is for Frontend Mentor challenges I am completing to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. I highly recommend Frontend Mentor challenges if you're interested in practicing. 

###Some notes about the challenges

- These challenges have basic accessibility requirements. As they are written, they mostly don't pass color contrast but I was trying to meet spec so I tried to stick as closely to the comp as I could.
- The components have responsive versions. As I went on I started working more on making the breakpoints attractive.

## Challenges in this repository, in the order I completed them

###QR code component


###Results summary component


###Single price grid component


###3-column preview card component
I experimented with BEM on this project. I liked the way the CSS looked.

###Testimonials grid section
I was starting to get a lot more comfortable with basic grid here, and learned some more specific styling like differentiating row and column gaps. I am really digging grid.
I also tried to use BEM on this component but I started to confuse myself with the class names. I felt like I was creating too many classes. Also it was hard to get the quotes image to display correctly. I ended up nuking it from orbit and starting over. I'm very happy with how it came out.
It still feels like I may have used too many classes.
